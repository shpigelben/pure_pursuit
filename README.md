- [x] Create the animator in a different function that can be called.
    - Added `animate.animate_simulation` which supports any number of pursuers and/or evaders via iterable inputs.
- [ ] Implement the possibility of generating interesting trajectories for the b (Bezier curves)
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated pursuit algorithms
- [ ] Compare pursuit algorithms
- [ ] need to create an abstraction for Pursuer Evader -> Agent.
    - [ ] insert pursuit types into the Evader.
- [ ] simulation.py module advances one time step of the entire eimulation
- [ ] animation.py used the simulation.py to iterate over time steps and plot a visualization.
